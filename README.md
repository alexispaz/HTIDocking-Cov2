# Content

The `structures/` folder contains the protein structures used in the
publication.

The `hards/` folder contains the scripts used to obtain by the high active
repurpoused drugs (HARDs) list, following the procedure explained in the main
publication.

The `hards/output_27/` folder contains the HARDs lists and other data
obtained from this scripts.
